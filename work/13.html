      <p class="pt-5">PR/Marketing department wanted an infographic to promote CNN's 2016 numbers. This infographic was the first of its kind in that PR never really had much design support.</p>
      <p>Originally made for the press release, the graphic was formatted for PR's webage but since then, it has been used on social media and conference presentations.</p>
      <p>View the press release <a href="http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2017/01/06/cnn-digital-2016-best-year-on-record/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
