        MailChimp meets Curious George
      </p>

      <p class="pt-5">This sign up form was a self-motivated personal project from the <a href="http://www.dailyui.co/" target="_blank">Daily UI Challenge</a> prompts. It had bothered me a long time why Curious George and MailChimp were not the same monkey and so embarked this project. The text is borrowed from MailChimp's website. I perused through parts of MailChimp's site to get an idea of what and when content appeared.</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: I lay no claim to Curious George.</p>
