      <p class="pt-5">It all happened in one day. I find out a story documenting insults between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will be published by EOB. I had been working on a timeline template for a while and found this story to be a good opportunity to use it. I worked on the illustration assets and handed off animtaion to <a href="https://www.kelly-flynn.com/" target="_blank">Kelly Flynn</a> so I could focus on implementing the timeline. It all came together in the end <i class="em em-sweat_smile"></i></p>
