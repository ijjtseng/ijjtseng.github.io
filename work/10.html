        Sponsored content for BP with The Washington Post
      </p>

      <p class="pt-5">A Digital Oilfield was about using drones and sensor technology for oil pipelines to provide safer and more environmentally friendly practices for transporting oil. Naturally with the reputation surrounding BP and oil in general, the client felt that a branded page would be a turn-off to readers.</p>
      <p>Being that BP was trying to promote its clean energy efforts and the setting of the story was Alaska, I took a light cleanliness approach and made sure that there was a focus on humanizing people who worked in the oil industry.</p>
      <p>The people imagery was from Shutterstock (hiring photographers on sponsored content assignments were very rare for budget reasons), showing real faces and diversity in the work zone.</p>
