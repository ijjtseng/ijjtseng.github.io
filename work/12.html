        I started with CNN July before the 2016 election. Needless to say, never ideal to start
        a new job at the height of chaos. This election season was in many ways different than previous
        elections, the tone and workpace from 2016 carried on for many years after.

        From the minute I joined the team, we were Working in realtime constantly without break.
        It was a two person design team (and stayed that way until 2019). We had to address design
        concerns on-the-go, work with people who had zero experience in design partnerships, and meanwhile
        set aside time to develop ideas for longer shelf-life or evergreen collateral.
