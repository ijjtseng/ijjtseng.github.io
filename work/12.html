      <p>I started with CNN July before the 2016 election. Needless to say, never ideal to start a new job at the height of chaos. This election season was in many ways different than previous elections.</p>
      <p>Working in realtime constantly. Two person design team. Proactive opportunistic graphics. Elevating the existing rigid style to something allowing for more flexibility and creativity.</p>
