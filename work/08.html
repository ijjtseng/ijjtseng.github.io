      <h1>Big Little<br/>Picture</h1>
      <p><em>Advertising, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop</em><br/>
        Sponsored content for Bank of America with The Washington Post
      </p>

      <p class="pt-5">During my time at The Washington Post's digial advertising department, the vast majority of our projects had a two-day deadline. Many factors contributed to the two-day dealine but one thing for certain is that the two-day deadline for sponsored content was usually for the inital design for any product. Even though it was the inital design, clients often took them literally and whatever was made from the start would also be there are the very end.</p>
      <p>Going by the two-day deadline (or 16 business hours), I would dedicate the first 4 hours to brainstorming artistic direction and content. Content was usually absent, I would sometimes actually create content and specifically ways to visualize possible content, or just have lorem ipsum text. The next 8 hours would be dedicated to production, and the last 4 hours for any last minute changes and proofing.</p>
      <p>For this particular project, there was a concept "The Big Little Picture" and some idea about being able to feature various subject matter experts and we had some quotes, and we needed a mock to show to the client. I created an interface featuring various experts and added a more human element via icons and typography. As I was creating the mock, I received messages about changes or additions to the inital project reqirements &emdash; the most important of which was to be able to have a way for people to access more evergreen information. I added a tab using the same visual style to tie the aesthetics together.</p>
