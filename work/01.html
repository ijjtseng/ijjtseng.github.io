      <h2 class="pt-3">Throwing insults</h2>
      <p>
        Animation for CNN on a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/22/politics/donald-trump-north-korea-insults-timeline/index.html" target="_blank">story</a>
        documenting insults between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. I developed concept and assets, animation by
        <a href="https://www.kelly-flynn.com/" target="_blank">Kelly Flynn</a> so I could focus on
        implementing the HTML/CSS timeline element inside the story.

      <h2 class="pt-3">GOP Popularity</h2>
      <p>
        A few polls came out about the Republican Party and Donald Trump's approval rating rising after a little over a year since President Trump was elected. The approval rate has risen but not a significant change overall.

      <h2 class="pt-3">CNN Digital 2016 EOY numbers</h2>
      <p>
        PR/Marketing department wanted an infographic to promote CNN's 2016 numbers.
        This infographic was the first of its kind in that PR never really had much design support.

        Originally made for the <a href="http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2017/01/06/cnn-digital-2016-best-year-on-record/" target="_blank">press release</a>,
        the graphic was formatted for PR's webage but since then, it has been used on social media
        and conference presentations.
