      <p class="pt-5">The old presidential library was last updated when Obama was first inaugurated in 2009 and it was running on Flash. This project was completed at the beginning of 2017, with a new president comes a refresh (along with a new inauguration speech).</p>
      <p>View the library <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/words-from-the-past/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>My inital design pitch to the boss was admittedly not a style typically seen in Politics. I wanted to find a way to branch out and create a more unique and on-trend CNN Politics style. Not that trendiness matters in Politics (or does it?) but most all media companies had very stoic styles for politic-news content. This project helped me inform the <a href="07.html" target="_blank">Politics rebrand and styleguide</a>.</p>
      <p>The first draft combined geometric trends with the previous handdrawn doodle style from 2016 elections and past.</p>

      <p>Draft got nixed for something more evergreen and easier to mass produce. While it was important to update the speech library, it wasn't a main page view driver so it didn't make sense to spend an inordinate amount of time on the revamp.</p>
