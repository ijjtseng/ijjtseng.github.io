      <h1>BRT Sustainability</h1>
      <p><em>Advertising, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop</em><br/>
        Sponsored content for BRT with The Washington Post
      </p>

      <p class="pt-5">This project spanned about a week, the client already had content available taken from one of their publications. The topic was sustainable business practices and at the very least they wanted to feature various factoids from the publication.</p>
      <p>Before The Washington Post, I had little professional experience in digital design but by this point, my visual design was starting to get more nuanced.</p>
      <p>I created the mock in two days, and then we had some back and forth with the client. The original mock contained different photography, we swaped out the photography in the hero to match the publication's illustrative cover and the rest of the photography was changed to match each section subtopic.</p>
