        I had been working on ways to show stories on homepage as a pet project and
        it came to life on two main occasions &mdash; State of the Union fact check evening
        and President Trump's speech on declaring a national emergency on the US southern border.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the same time, I became involved in fact check stories
        (known as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/fact-check-politics" target="_blank">Facts First</a>).
         Designed and developed fact check story layouts.
