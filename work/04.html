      <h1>AR-15 Rifle<br/>History</h1>
      <p><em>Editorial, Illustration, HTML/CSS, Data visualizations</em><br/>
        How an 'ugly,' unwanted weapon became the most popular rifle in America
      </p>

      <p class="pt-5">This story was published after the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/05/us/first-baptist-church/index.html" target="_blank">Sutherland Springs shooting</a> in November 2017. I got looped into the project one morning and the visualizations took me a full 8-hourish or more work day to complete. The content became available on a rolling basis. First, I completed the diagrams and graphs. One of the data viz was more of a text-based 'big giant number' type viz so I have that viz breaking out as you would a pull quote &mdash; CNN really loves to do full-width graphics all the time and I have been trying to break up the text for easier legibility, and create heirachy among the graphics. When the editor realized I was able to create the floating left/right elements on the page, we talked about taking quotes or highlights from the story so I went through and dropped those in as well. If it weren't for the deadline, I likely would have added spot illustrations as well but there is enough going on visually by this point.
      </p>
      <p>The illustration/graphic came last &mdash; with all the gun control talks as of late, the biggest challenge has been how to illustrate guns without glorifying or demonizing them. Photographs are one thing, but then doing a cutout of a gun almost seems too raw of a visual. Or maybe raw is what we need? For this particular illustration, I lean closer to the silhouette to follow the vector patterns and textures of the overall style.
