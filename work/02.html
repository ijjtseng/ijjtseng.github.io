      <p class="pt-5">Originally thought I had a couple days to work on this project only to realize that day was actually a Friday and the story was to publish on Sunday night (it was a very long day). The initial direction I was going to take would have involved more hand-drawn elements to <a href="/images/marimekko.jpg" target="_blank" title="Credit: Aino-Maija Metsola for Marimekko">evoke a more child-likeness</a> since this story was written for a protest against gun violence after the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/18/us/parkland-florida-school-shooting-accounts/index.html" target="_blank">Parkland school shooting</a>. Upon realizing the deadline, it was around 4pm and so I came up with a plan B--which is what you see here.</p>

      <blockquote>If you're a student who's thinking of taking part (or thet parent of one), you probably have lots of questions: Can the school retaliate? Will it hurt your chances of college? Can you just stay home for the day?</blockquote>
