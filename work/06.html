        A bunch of races moving left

      <p class="pt-5">As soon as I came in that morning, got an update to the Key Races (which meant updating 4-6 other related graphics). For this update in particular, all the races were moving to the left. The editor really wanted a visual to show all how all the races were leaning Democratic so I made this GIF. I rarely take on AfterEffects work with CNN because I deal with breaking or real-time news, but Key Races fall under my realm so here we are!</p>
